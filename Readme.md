<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>

The first challenge of 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge)). The challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

There will be no extra challenges in this project.
